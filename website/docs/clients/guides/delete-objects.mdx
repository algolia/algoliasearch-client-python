In Algolia, you can delete multiple objects efficiently using the batch functionality. This guide will show you how to delete multiple objects at once.

## Delete Multiple Objects

To delete multiple objects using batch, create a *batch write params*  object that contains the array of delete requests. 
Each delete request should have the `action` set to `deleteObject` and the `body` containing the respective object ID. 
This allows you to define multiple delete operations within the `requests` array.

<TabsLanguage>
<TabItem value="javascript">

```javascript
const objectIDs = ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5'];

const batchWriteParams = {
  requests: objectIDs.map(id => ({
    action: 'deleteObject',
    body: {
      objectID: id,
    },
  })),
};

await client.batch({ indexName, batchWriteParams });
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="php">

php

// TODO

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java">

java

// TODO

</TabItem>
</TabsLanguage>

By executing the above code, all the objects with the specified object IDs will be deleted from your index.

That's it! You have successfully deleted multiple objects using `batch`.
