    Strategy for removing words from the query when it doesn't return any results. This helps to avoid returning empty search results.  - `none`.   No words are removed when a query doesn't return results.  - `lastWords`.

Treat the first (then second, then third) word as optional,   until there are results or at most 5 words have been removed.  - `allOptional`.   Treat all words as optional.
