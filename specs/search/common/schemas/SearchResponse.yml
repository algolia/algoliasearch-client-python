    exhaustive:
      type: object
      title: exhaustive
      description: Whether certain properties of the search response are calculated exhaustive (exact) or approximated.
      properties:
        facetsCount:
          type: boolean
          title: facetsCount
          description: Whether the facet count is exhaustive (`true`) or approximate (`false`). See the [related discussion](https://support.algolia.com/hc/en-us/articles/4406975248145-Why-are-my-facet-and-hit-counts-not-accurate-).
        facetValues:
          type: boolean
          title: facetValues
          description: The value is `false` if not all facet values are retrieved.
        nbHits:
          type: boolean
          title: nbHits
          description: Whether the `nbHits` is exhaustive (`true`) or approximate (`false`). When the query takes more than 50ms to be processed, the engine makes an approximation. This can happen when using complex filters on millions of records, when typo-tolerance was not exhaustive, or when enough hits have been retrieved (for example, after the engine finds 10,000 exact matches). `nbHits` is reported as non-exhaustive whenever an approximation is made, even if the approximation didnâ€™t, in the end, impact the exhaustivity of the query.
        rulesMatch:
          type: boolean
          title: rulesMatch
          description: Rules matching exhaustivity. The value is `false` if rules were enable for this query, and could not be fully processed due a timeout. This is generally caused by the number of alternatives (such as typos) which is too large.
        typo:
          type: boolean
          title: typo
          description: Whether the typo search was exhaustive (`true`) or approximate (`false`). An approximation is done when the typo search query part takes more than 10% of the query budget (ie. 5ms by default) to be processed (this can happen when a lot of typo alternatives exist for the query). This field will not be included when typo-tolerance is entirely disabled.
