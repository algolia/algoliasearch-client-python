  summary: Copy, move, or rename an index.
  description: |-
    This `operation`, _copy_ or _move_, will copy or move a source index's (`IndexName`) records, settings, synonyms, and rules to a `destination` index.
    If the destination index exists, it will be replaced, except for index-specific API keys and analytics data.
    If the destination index doesn't exist, it will be created.

    The choice between moving or copying an index depends on your needs. Choose:

    - **Move** to rename an index.
    - **Copy** to create a new index with the same records and configuration as an existing one.

    > **Note**: When considering copying or moving, be aware of the [rate limitations](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/scaling/algolia-service-limits/#application-record-and-index-limits) on these processes and the [impact on your analytics data](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/manage-indices-and-apps/manage-indices/concepts/indices-analytics/).

                If you omit `scope`, the copy command copies all records, settings, synonyms, and rules.
                
                If you specify `scope`, only the specified scopes are copied.
