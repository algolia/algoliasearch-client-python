        **`stopwordEntry`**

        The stop word you want to add or update. If the entry already exists in Algolia's standard dictionary, you can override its behavior by adding it to the custom dictionary and setting its `state` to `disabled`.

        **`compoundEntry`**

        When `decomposition` is empty: adds `word` as a compound atom.
        For example, atom “kino” decomposes the query “kopfkino” into "kopf" and "kino".
        
        When `decomposition` isn't empty: creates a decomposition exception.
        For example, when decomposition is set to the ["hund", "hutte"] exception, "hundehutte" decomposes into “hund” and “hutte”, discarding the linking "e".
      example: 'down'
