    indexes:
      type: array
      description: >
        Restricts this API key to a list of indices or index patterns. If the list is empty, all indices are allowed.

        Specify either an exact index name or a pattern with a leading or trailing wildcard character (or both). For example:

        - `dev_*` matches all indices starting with "dev_"
        - `*_dev` matches all indices ending with "_dev"
        - `*_products_*` matches all indices containing "_products_".
      example: ['dev_*','prod_products']

    maxHitsPerQuery:
      type: integer
      description: >
        Maximum number of hits this API key can retrieve in one query. If zero, no limit is enforced.

        > **Note**: Use this parameter to protect you from third-party attempts to retrieve your entire content by massively querying the index.
      default: 0
    maxQueriesPerIPPerHour:
      type: integer
      description: >
        Maximum number of API calls per hour allowed from a given IP address or [user token](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-events/concepts/usertoken/).

        Each time an API call is performed with this key, a check is performed. If there were more than the specified number of calls within the last hour, the API returns an error with the status code `429` (Too Many Requests).


        > **Note**: Use this parameter to protect you from third-party attempts to retrieve your entire content by massively querying the index.
      default: 0
    queryParameters:
      type: string
      description: >
        Force some [query parameters](https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-reference/api-parameters/) to be applied for each query made with this API key.
        
        It's a URL-encoded query string.
      example: 'typoTolerance%3Dstrict%26ignorePlurals%3Dfalse%26filters%3Drights%3Apublic'
      default: ''
    referers:
      type: array
      description: >
        Restrict this API key to specific [referrers](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/security/api-keys/in-depth/api-key-restrictions/#http-referrers). If empty, all referrers are allowed.

        For example:

        - `https://algolia.com/*` matches all referrers starting with "https://algolia.com/"
        - `*.algolia.com` matches all referrers ending with ".algolia.com"
        - `*algolia.com*` allows everything in the domain "algolia.com".
      example: ['*algolia.com*']
      default: []
      items:
        type: string
    validity:
      type: integer
      description: >
        Validity duration of a key (in seconds).  The key will automatically be removed after this time has expired. The default value of 0 never expires.

        Short-lived API keys are useful to grant temporary access to your data. For example, in mobile apps, you can't [control when users update your app](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/security/security-best-practices/#use-secured-api-keys-in-mobile-apps). So instead of encoding keys into your app as you would for a web app, you should dynamically fetch them from your mobile app's backend.
