      Facets to use as top categories with your suggestions.

      If provided, Query Suggestions adds the top facet values to each suggestion.
    example: [{'attribute': 'category', 'amount': 3}, {'attribute': 'brand', 'amount': 2}]
  minHits:

      Minimum number of hits required to be included as a suggestion.

      A search query must at least generate `minHits` hits to be included in the Query Suggestions index.

        Facets used for generating query suggestions from facet values.

        For example, if you set `generate: ["color", "brand"]`, combinations from the facet values are added as query suggestions,
        such as "blue adidas", "red adidas", "blue nike", "red nike", etc.

        You can include nested lists.
      example: ['color', 'brand']

      Algolia indices with popular searches to use as query suggestions.

      Records of these indices must have these attributes:

        - `query`: search query which will be added as a suggestion
        - `count`: measure of popularity of that search query

      For example, you can export popular searches from an external analytics tool, such as Google Analytics or Adobe Analytics,
      and feed this data into an external Algolia index.
      You can use this external index to generate query suggestions until your Algolia analytics has collected enough data.
