  summary: Get click positions.
  description: |
    Show the number of clicks events and their associated position in the search results.

    > **Note**: If all `positions` have a `clickCount` of `0` or `null`, it means Algolia didn't receive any click events for tracked searches. A _tracked_ search is a search request where the `clickAnalytics` parameter is `true`.

                        - For positions 1 to 10, the number of click events are shown for each position
                        - For positions 11 to 20, all click events are grouped
                        - For positions 21 and up, all click events are grouped.
