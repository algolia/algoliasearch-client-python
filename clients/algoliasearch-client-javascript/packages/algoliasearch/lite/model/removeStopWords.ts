This list will override any values that you may have set in `queryLanguages`. _true_: enables the stop words feature, ensuring that stop words are removed from consideration in a search. The languages supported here are either [every language](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/optimize-search-results/handling-natural-languages-nlp/in-depth/supported-languages/) (this is the default) or those set by `queryLanguages`. _false_: turns off the stop words feature, allowing stop words to be taken into account in a search.
