## ðŸ“š Description

`algoliasearch` is a comprehensive Dart package that provides access to Algolia's robust search and insights features. It is an all-in-one solution designed to help you integrate Algolia within your Dart project seamlessly and efficiently.

The package currently offers the following clients:

- **Search Client**: Allows you to leverage Algolia's search capabilities, including instant search results, search-as-you-type, and typo-tolerance.
- **Insights Client**: Enables you to collect events related to your search and discovery experience, providing valuable insights into user behavior. With it, you can unlock powerful features such as recommendations, personalization, and smarter search results.
- **Search Lite Client**: A lighter, search-only version of the library, perfect for projects that require search functionality without the need for features like indexing.

Future updates will include more clients to cover the entirety of Algolia's feature set, providing a complete toolset for building powerful, interactive search experiences in your Dart or Flutter application.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Low-Level HTTP Client**: Provides a thin and minimal low-level HTTP client to interact directly with Algolia's API, giving you maximum control over your requests.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Designed to work seamlessly on both native and web platforms, making it ideal for any Dart project.
- **Pure Dart Construction**: Built with pure Dart for superior performance and maximum compatibility across Dart projects.
