/**
 * Insights event.
 *
 * @param eventType
 * @param eventName A user-defined string used to categorize events.
 * @param index Name of the targeted index.
 * @param userToken A user identifier. Depending if the user is logged-in or not, several strategies can be used from a sessionId to a technical identifier. You should always send pseudonymous or anonymous userTokens.
 * @param timestamp Time of the event expressed in milliseconds since the Unix epoch.
 * @param queryID Algolia queryID. This is required when an event is tied to a search.
 * @param objectIDs An array of index objectID. Limited to 20 objects. An event can’t have both objectIDs and filters at the same time.
 * @param filters An array of filters. Limited to 10 filters. An event can’t have both objectIDs and filters at the same time.
 * @param positions Position of the click in the list of Algolia search results. This field is required if a queryID is provided. One position must be provided for each objectID.
