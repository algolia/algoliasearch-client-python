/**
 * Use this event to track when users add items to their shopping cart after a previous Algolia request. If you're building your category pages with Algolia, you'll also use this event.
 *
 * @param eventName Can contain up to 64 ASCII characters.   Consider naming events consistently—for example, by adopting Segment's [object-action](https://segment.com/academy/collecting-data/naming-conventions-for-clean-data/#the-object-action-framework) framework.
 * @param eventType
 * @param eventSubtype
 * @param index Name of the Algolia index.
 * @param queryID Unique identifier for a search query.  The query ID is required for events related to search or browse requests. If you add `clickAnalytics: true` as a search request parameter, the query ID is included in the API response.
 * @param objectIDs List of object identifiers for items of an Algolia index.
 * @param userToken Anonymous or pseudonymous user identifier.   > **Note**: Never include personally identifiable information in user tokens.
 * @param objectData Extra information about the records involved in the event—for example, to add price and quantities of purchased products.  If provided, must be the same length as `objectIDs`.
 * @param currency If you include pricing information in the `objectData` parameter, you must also specify the currency as ISO-4217 currency code, such as USD or EUR.
 * @param timestamp Time of the event in milliseconds in [Unix epoch time](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time). By default, the Insights API uses the time it receives an event as its timestamp.
 * @param authenticatedUserToken User token for authenticated users.
